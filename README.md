# Calculus Visualizer

A web-based tool designed to help students visualize and understand various calculus concepts through interactive graphs and animations.

## Features

- **Function Plotter**: Visualize mathematical functions by plotting their graphs.
- **Derivative Visualizer**: Understand the concept of derivatives by observing the slope of tangent lines at various points on a function's curve.
- **Integral Visualizer**: Explore definite integrals by visualizing the area under a curve between specified bounds.
- **Taylor Series Expansion**: Approximate functions using Taylor series and observe how the series converges to the actual function.

## Getting Started

To run the Calculus Visualizer locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omm2005/Calculus-Visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Calculus-Visualizer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
